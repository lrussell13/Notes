## Typography
Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language readable and beautiful

### Basic Principles
1. Use a font-size between 15 and 25 pixels for body text
  - This can depend on the font-face you choose
2. Use (really) big font sizes for headlines
  - It's a good idea to often make larger fonts have a lower weight, it can make them feel less bulky
3. Use line spacing between 120% and 150% of the font-size
4. Allow 45 to 90 characters per line to make content more readable
5. Use good fonts
